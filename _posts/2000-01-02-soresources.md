# Steward Observatory Resources

## [ATOMM](http://uaastroclub.org/resources/astronomy/atomm/)
### Undergraduate
### Main contact: Dr. Don McCarthy < <dmmcarthy@as.arizona.edu> >

Our department offers undergraduates a free study & tutoring environment known as the Astronomy Tutoring of Majors and Minors (ATOMM) program. On Tuesdays 2-4pm, Wednesdays 3-5pm, and Thursdays 1:30-3:30 pm, graduate student tutors help with homework and course material for a variety of classes in Astronomy, Physics and Math (including Vector Calculus and Differential Equations). There will also be undergraduates hanging out/working on upper-division classes for these as well. You do not need to be an astronomy major to attend! 

While ATOMM is usually held in the Parker Library in Steward Observatory, it is currently being conducted remotely due to COVID-19 at the same listed times. 

## Astronomy Peer Mentor Program
### Undergraduate
### Main contact: Dr. Don McCarthy < <dmmcarthy@as.arizona.edu> > 

A peer-to-peer mentorship program that pairs undergraduate underclassmen with upperclassmen. The purpose is for the upperclassmen to act as a mentor and provide advice, academic and professional development guidance, and support for their mentee. 

## Physics Club
### Undergraduate / Graduate
### Main contact: < <uaphysicsclub@gmail.com> >

The Physics Club seeks to create community within the Physics Department.  Physics Club hosts meetings every other week to discuss new physics concepts, do physics demonstrations, and meet with fellow peers who are interested in physics! Physics Club is a great place to learn more about physics concepts in a casual sphere, get to know more about what research is happening at the University of Arizona, or meet professors and undergraduate students within the department. This club is open to all majors and academic interests.

## Steward Observatory Graduate Student Council
### Graduate
### Main contact: TBD

The Grad Council serves as an interface between the graduate students and faculty of the Astronomy Department, and acts as a line of communication with departmental administration. The Grad Council mainly serves the educational and scientific needs of the graduate student population, by advocating for student concerns, facilitating academic and non-academic career needs and current students, and assisting in the recruitment and retention of future students.
