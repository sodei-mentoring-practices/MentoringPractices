# Steward Observatory Resources

## [ATOMM](http://uaastroclub.org/resources/astronomy/atomm/)
### Undergraduate
### Main contact: Dr. Don McCarthy <dmmcarthy@as.arizona.edu>

Our department offers undergraduates a free study & tutoring environment known as the Astronomy Tutoring of Majors and Minors (ATOMM) program. On Tuesdays 2-4pm, Wednesdays 3-5pm, and Thursdays 1:30-3:30 pm, graduate student tutors help with homework and course material for a variety of classes in Astronomy, Physics and Math (including Vector Calculus and Differential Equations). There will also be undergraduates hanging out/working on upper-division classes for these as well. You do not need to be an astronomy major to attend! 

While ATOMM is usually held in the Parker Library in Steward Observatory, it is currently being conducted remotely due to COVID-19 at the same listed times. 




- Each vertical section is a markdown file in **_posts/** directory.
  * They're sorted by 'date'. (we don't use date anywhere, it only sorts)
- Each vertical section sets it's own **color**, **header icon** (or image), **title**, and easy-to-write markdown body.
- Only **two things** to edit:
  1. Edit `_config.yml` to set the site title, description, etc
  2. Add `_posts/*.md` to make each vertical section. Copy some examples and add the sections from your README.md for a fast start!
- Easy adding of **SEO terms**, **favicon** & such, and **google analytics token**.
