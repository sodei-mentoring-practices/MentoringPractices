# SO DEI Mentoring Practices
{: .text-purple}

Admitting more underrepresented minority (URM) groups into our program is not enough if there is not the environment to support them through the program.  URM groups report experiencing a “leaky pipeline”, in that the systems in place in the organization do not support, and in some cases are actively hostile to, their feeling of being valued and belonging within the organization.  The focus of this task force is to identify ways we can increase support and retention of URM groups once they become a part of our organization through to graduation and beyond.  Effective mentoring practices is one important/effective way to accomplish this.  And looking to improve mentoring for URM retention improves mentoring for all students of all identities.
