# University-level resources

## [Arizona Space Grant Consortium](https://spacegrant.arizona.edu/students/fellowships)
### Undergraduate & Graduate
### Main contact: Michelle Coe < <macoe@lpl.arizona.edu> >

The Arizona Space Grant Consortium is a NASA-led program that provides internship and fellowship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

## [Arizona's Science, Engineering, and Math Scholars (ASEMS)](https://asems.arizona.edu/about)
### Undergraduate

The ASEMS program provides services to support students who intend to graduate with a STEM major through access to counseling, tutoring, and development opportunities. The program especially focuses on students underrepresented in STEM, first generation students, low-income students, and transfer students. The program goals include helping students form career identities, develop communication and confidence skills, and help students develop skill-sets required to be professionally competitive in STEM. 

## [ASEMS Veterans](https://asems.arizona.edu/programs/asems-veterans)
### Undergraduate

The ASEMS-Veterans program provides much of the same services as the normal ASEMS program (see above) but is specifically built for military veteran students in STEM fields. 

## [Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)](https://gpsc.arizona.edu)
### Graduate

The Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) promotes graduate student interests  to the University Administration, and designs and implements University-level programs that benefit the entire graduate student body. One notable program for astronomy graduate students is the [GPSC Travel Grant](https://gpsc.arizona.edu/travel-grants), which provides funding for both domestic and international conferences.

## [Graduate Centre Resources](https://gradcenter.arizona.edu/resources)
### Graduate

The Graduate College provides resources for graduate students on topics including, but not limited to, professional development, research, teaching, and mentoring.

## [Diversity & Inclusion Office Resources](https://diversity.arizona.edu/mentoring-resources)
### Faculty & General

The University of Arizona’s Diversity & Inclusion Office provides a list of resources (both research and actionable guides/tools) for successful mentoring relationships, from both the mentor and mentee perspective.

## Responsible Conduct in Research Mentoring Agreement
### LINK TBD !!

A mentoring agreement is a reference document that helps establish the groundwork for a productive mentoring relationship. It helps both mentors and mentees manage expectations, and clearly defines the boundaries of the working relationship. This document is an example of a mentoring agreement provided by the University of Arizona’s Responsible Conduct in Research training conducted in Fall 2020.

## [Thrive Centre Mentoring Programs](https://thrive.arizona.edu/)
### Undergraduate

Thrive Center’s stated mission is to “advance a community where students successfully navigate through, excel in, and graduate from the University of Arizona prepared for life after college.” They provide peer mentoring programs, career and life-skill workshops, community building events, and more for all UA students, especially those underrepresented, low-income, or first generation.
